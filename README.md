# ðŸŽ¸ Tone Tuner
I got tired of loading up a YouTube video just to hear some pitches with this to tune my guitar.  
And while I know I could just buy a tuner or something, why would I do that when I could learn some ToneJS?

Clicking on buttons plays the tone.  
If you're on mobile, make sure your phone is not on silent...

Happy tuning,
